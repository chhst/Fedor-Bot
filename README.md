# Fedor-Bot
Hello! I'm a programming beginner and made a chat manager analogue of Iris! Fedor bot! 

==== WHAT CAN THIS BOT DO? ====
1. Has its own moderation system (Femboy Mod. System (FMS))
2. Own currency (coins and femdits (something like a kopeck and a ruble)
3. Accounts, prefixes, commands, and communication with the bot!
Since this is my first major program, it has some functions that don't work well! The code is completely open and anyone can edit it! Make your own Fedor bot!
